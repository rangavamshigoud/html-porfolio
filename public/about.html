<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Meet Akshay, the quintessential Hyderabad boy who's a living, breathing embodiment of the city's charm and quirks. 
  Raised in the land of Nizams and biryanis, Akshay's multilingual skills are so impressive that he once confused Siri 
  with his seamless switch between Telugu, Urdu, Hindi, and English. His tongue is like a linguistic gymnast, flipping 
  through languages faster than a dosa on a hot griddle.</p>

<p>Now, let's talk about Akshay's love affair with Hyderabadi cuisine. If there's one thing that can distract him from 
  coding (and that's saying something), it's the aroma of biryani wafting through the air. Rumor has it he once wrote a 
  Python script to calculate the optimal biryani-to-raita ratio, because, well, priorities.</p>

<p>On weekends, you'll find Akshay channeling his inner cricket superstar in local gully matches. His batting stance is
   a mix of Virat Kohli's intensity and the casual swagger of Hyderabadi Street cricketers. He claims he once hit a six 
   that landed right in a biryani vendor's cauldron, earning him the title of "Biryani Bomber" among his friends.</p> 
<p>With a heart as warm as a plate of haleem and a sense of humor spicier than Mirchi ka Salan, Akshay is the kind of 
  guy who brings Hyderabad's vibrant spirit wherever he goes. After all, life is too short for boring storiesâ€”let's 
  add a dash of Hyderabadi spice to the narrative!</p>
